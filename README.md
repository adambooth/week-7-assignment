week-7-assignment

Project Description:
A forum where people can create and see posts with filtering.

Things i struggled with:
Filtering i found some work online to help me with the filtering in react
liking and deleting comments(had to look online)

Things i did well:
Setting up the React client & server.
Deploying to render.
Use of Github.
Responsiveness & CSS
Form Validation.
SQL Queries

Things ive learnt:
I can successfully say i can setup a client, server and deploy with ease using render and github.
I learnt how to filter data and show the correct data on screen.
I got a better understanding of react, APIs and Polling

Requested Feedback:
A youtube video on liking and deleting comments if possible. I have an idea how this would work if a user was logged in and could be recognised with a ID.
